## Project Description
Technology has become interlock with daily life for many people in today's age. Due to this, many users are requires to create and keep track of passwords to login to their favorite websites and softwares. Many users have resorted to creating easy to memorize passwords for such accounts, leaving their accounts vulnerable to dictionary attacks. 
We wanted to created a simple swift mobile app where users can generate passworde more efficent passwords. Any password generated is saved onto a table which users are easily able to click on, having the string of passwords be copy onto their iPhone's clipboard to paste onto any website or app. 
Users can also save their their own passwords onto the table, allowing easy access to paste it on any textfield with a simple click.
## Limitations
- we were unable to save the passwords after exiting the program due to time constrains. This can be easilyng fix by saving all the files into a txt file and updating the file everytime a password is created or deleted.
