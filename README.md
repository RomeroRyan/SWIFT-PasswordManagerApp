## Project Description
Technology has become interlocked with everyday life for people in today's age. Due to this fact, many users are required to create and keep track of passwords to interact with their favorite websites and apps. Many users have resorted to creating easy to memorize passwords for their accounts, leaving them vulnerable to dictionary attacks. 
- We wanted to created a simple swift mobile app where users can quickly generate a strong password. Any passwords generated will be saved into a table where users can tap  each entry and the password will be copied onto their iPhone's clipboard to easily paste onto any website or app. 
- Users can also save their their own passwords onto the table by entering into the available textbox and using the submit button, allowing the password to be easily copied to their iPhone's clipboard with one simple tap
## Limitations
- The program is currently unable to save passwords between sessions
- Currently, the GUI only seems to display properly on larger phones such as the iPhone 12 max
